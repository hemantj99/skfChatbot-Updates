### What is SKF?
Security Knowledge Framework (SKF) is a tool that is used as a guide for building and verifying secure software. It can also be used to train developers about application security. The OWASP Security Knowledge Framework is an expert system web-application that uses the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard and other resources. It can be used to support developers in pre-development (security by design) as well as after code is released (OWASP ASVS Level 1-3).

### Introduction of SKF-Chatbot:

#### What is Chatbot?
Chatbots are software agents that interact with the user in a conversation. A chatbot is a service which is provided by websites so that users can easily able to fetch information interactively. They can reach out to a large audience on messaging apps and be more effective. A chatbot provides a speedy and quick response and available around the clock. Chatbot will be an attempt to reduce the pain of the user and will help users in finding solutions to their problems and thus improving the security of code and infrastructure.

#### What is SKF-Chatbot?
SKF-Chatbot is the bot which will help you with the details or answer your queries about the different vulnerabilities. The bot can be asked about the **description, solution** of the vulnerability and also help you with the **code snippet** in various languages.
**Language Supported: Django, Java, Flask, Php, Ruby**

##### For ex: If you ask What is XSS?
It will answer you with the description of xss.
**Something like this:** Description for xss injection is : Every time the application gets userinput, whether this showing it on screen or processingthis data in the application background, these parameters should be escaped for maliciouscode in order to prevent crosssite scripting injections.When an attacker gains the possibility to perform an XSS injection,he is given the opportunity to inject HTML and JavaScript code directly into theapplication. This could lead to accounts being compromised by stealing session cookies or directly affect the operation of the target application. 

Similarly, you can ask for the **solution** like: How to solve xss, How to resolve csrf etc. And for the **code** example it can be like code for xss filtering in java.
