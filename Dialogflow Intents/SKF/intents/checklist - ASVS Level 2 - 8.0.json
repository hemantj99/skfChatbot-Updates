([C8](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls#tab\u003dFormal_Numbering))\n8.3.5 Verify accessing sensitive data is audited (without logging the sensitive data itself); if the data is collected under relevant data protection directives or where logging of access is required.\n8.3.6 Verify that sensitive information contained in memory is overwritten as soon as it is no longer required to mitigate memory dumping attacks, using zeroes or random data.\n8.3.7 Verify that sensitive or private information that is required to be encrypted, is encrypted using approved algorithms that provide both confidentiality and integrity. ([C8](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls#tab\u003dFormal_Numbering))\n8.3.8 Verify that sensitive personal information is subject to data retention classification, such that old or out of date data is deleted automatically, on a schedule, or as the situation requires."
