For example, backup files (e.g. .bak); temporary working files (e.g. .swp); compressed files (.zip, .tar.gz, etc) and other extensions commonly used by editors should be blocked unless required.\n12.5.2 Verify that direct requests to uploaded files will never be executed as HTML/JavaScript content.\n12.6.1 Verify that the web or application server is configured with a whitelist of resources or systems to which the server can send requests or load data/files from."
