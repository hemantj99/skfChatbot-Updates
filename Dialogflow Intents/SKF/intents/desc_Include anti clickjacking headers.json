Thus, the attacker is \\\"hijacking\\\" clicks meant for their page and routing them to another page, most likely owned by another application, domain, or both.Using a similar technique, keystrokes can also be hijacked. With a carefully crafted combination of stylesheets, iframes, and text boxes, a user can be led to believe they are typing in the password to their email or bank account, but are instead typing into an invisible frame controlled by the attacker."
