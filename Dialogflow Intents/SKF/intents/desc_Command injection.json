Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell.In this attack, the attackersupplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation. This attack differs from Code Injection, in that code injection allows the attacker to adds his own code that is then executed by the application. In Code Injection, the attacker extends the default functionality of the application without the necessity of executing system commands."
