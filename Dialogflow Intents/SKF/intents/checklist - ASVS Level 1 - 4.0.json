This implies protection against spoofing and elevation of privilege. ([C7](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls#tab\u003dFormal_Numbering))\n4.1.4 Verify that the principle of deny by default exists whereby new users/roles start with minimal or no permissions and users/roles do not receive access to new features until access is explicitly assigned. \n4.1.5 Verify that access controls fail securely including when an exception occurs. ([C10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls#tab\u003dFormal_Numbering))\n4.2.1 Verify that sensitive data and APIs are protected against direct object attacks targeting creation, reading, updating and deletion of records, such as creating or updating someone else\u0027s record, viewing everyone\u0027s records, or deleting all records.\n4.2.2 Verify that the application or framework enforces a strong anti-CSRF mechanism to protect authenticated functionality, and effective anti-automation or anti-CSRF protects unauthenticated functionality.\n4.3.1 Verify administrative interfaces use appropriate multi-factor authentication to prevent unauthorized use.\n4.3.2 Verify that directory browsing is disabled unless deliberately desired. Additionally, applications should not allow discovery or disclosure of file or directory metadata, such as Thumbs.db, .DS_Store, .git or .svn folders.\n4.3.3 Verify the application has additional authorization (such as step up or adaptive authentication) for lower value systems, and / or segregation of duties for high value applications to enforce anti-fraud controls as per the risk of application and past fraud."
