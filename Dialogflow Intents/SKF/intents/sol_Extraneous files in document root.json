You may have .git,.svn folders and .gitignore files. If you are using IDE project files, you may have .idea hidden folder. Even there are chances of configuration files with common extensions, like config.json, config.yml, config.xml, package.json, .htaccess, README.md files to be present in the document root.Even there are chances of having swap files, backup files to be there in the document root.The solution for this problem is to prevent directory listing , remove the hidden folders, files and configuration files. We can even prevent the users from accessing this files with properly configuring the configuration files of the server like .htaccess files.\""
