You could start by sanitizing userinput as soon as it is inserted into the application, by preference using a so called whitelisting method. This means you should not check for malicious content like the tags or anything, but only allow the expected input. Every input which is outside of the intended operation of the application should immediately be detected and login rejected. Do not try to help use the input in any way because that could introduce a new type of attack by converting characters. The second step would be encoding all the parameters or userinput before putting this in your html with encoding libraries specially designed for this purpose.You should take into consideration that there are several contexts for encoding userinput for escaping XSS injections."

HTML URL encoding ;This type of encoding/escaping should be applied to whenever you are using userinput into a HREF tag.JavaScript encoding should be used whenever parameters are rendered via JavaScript; your application will detect normal injections in the first instant. But your application still remains vulnerable to JavaScript encoding which will not be detected by the normal encoding/escaping methods."
