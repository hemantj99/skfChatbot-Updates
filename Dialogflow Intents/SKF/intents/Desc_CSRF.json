For example, this attack could result in a transfer of funds, changing a password, or purchasing an item in the users context. In effect, CSRF attacks are used by an attacker to make a target system perform a function (funds Transfer, form submission etc.) via the targets browser without knowledge of the target user at least until the unauthorised function has been committed. \","
