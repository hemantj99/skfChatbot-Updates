([C6](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls#tab\u003dFormal_Numbering))\n3.2.2 Verify that session tokens possess at least 64 bits of entropy. ([C6](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls#tab\u003dFormal_Numbering))\n3.2.3 Verify the application only stores session tokens in the browser using secure methods such as appropriately secured cookies (see section 3.4) or HTML 5 session storage.\n3.3.1 Verify that logout and expiration invalidate the session token, such that the back button or a downstream relying party does not resume an authenticated session, including across relying parties. ([C6](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls#tab\u003dFormal_Numbering))\n3.3.2 If authenticators permit users to remain logged in, verify that re-authentication occurs periodically both when actively used or after an idle period. ([C6](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls#tab\u003dFormal_Numbering))\n3.3.3 Verify that the application terminates all other active sessions after a successful password change, and that this is effective across the application, federated login (if present); and any relying parties.\n3.3.4 Verify that users are able to view and log out of any or all currently active sessions and devices.\n3.4.1 Verify that cookie-based session tokens have the \u0027Secure\u0027 attribute set. ([C6](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls#tab\u003dFormal_Numbering))\n3.4.2 Verify that cookie-based session tokens have the \u0027HttpOnly\u0027 attribute set. ([C6](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls#tab\u003dFormal_Numbering))\n3.4.3 Verify that cookie-based session tokens utilize the \u0027SameSite\u0027 attribute to limit exposure to cross-site request forgery attacks. ([C6](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls#tab\u003dFormal_Numbering))\n3.4.4 Verify that cookie-based session tokens use \"__Host-\" prefix (see references) to provide session cookie confidentiality.\n3.4.5 Verify that if the application is published under a domain name with other applications that set or use session cookies that might override or disclose the session cookies, set the path attribute in cookie-based session tokens using the most precise path possible. ([C6](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls#tab\u003dFormal_Numbering))\n3.7.1 Verify the application ensures a valid login session or requires re-authentication or secondary verification before allowing any sensitive transactions or account modifications."
