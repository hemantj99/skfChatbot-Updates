Any state changing operation requires a secure random token (e.g CSRF token) to prevent against CSRF attacks. Characteristics of a CSRF Token are a unique, large random value generated by a cryptographically secure random number generator.The CSRF token is then added as a hidden field for forms and validated on the sever side whenever a user is sending a request to the server.Note : Whenever the application is an REST service and is using tokens such as JWT tokens, whenever these tokens are being sent in the application headers rather than stored in cookies the application should not be suspectible to CSRF attacks for a succesfull CSRF attacke depends on the browsers cookie jar."
