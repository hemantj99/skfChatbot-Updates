To mitigatethis attack, you can add your application to a preload list which makes HSTS enforced by default.When a user connects to one of these hosts for the first time, the browser will know thatit must use a secure connection. If a network attacker prevents secure connections to theserver, the browser will not attempt to connect over an insecure protocol, thusmaintaining the user\u0027s security.Visit:    https://hstspreload.appspot.com/Here you can find how to add your application to HSTS preload\""
