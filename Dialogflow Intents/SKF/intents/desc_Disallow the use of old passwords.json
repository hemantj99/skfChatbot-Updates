Because of password reuse, this could happen not only due to a leak in your site. Changing the password to a new one minimizes the damage.Also, users really don\u0027t like changing their passwords. So what users used to do when forced to change their password was to change it twice  once to some temporary password and then a second time back to the original password.\","
